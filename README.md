# bash
My collection of BASH scripts I find useful

Most of these scripts I made in the moment, but they work and they work wonderfully except I don't always remember to use them but when I do they help a lot.

Over time I will add more as I create more and remember where I placed them. Most of the time I do just do it in the terminal.
