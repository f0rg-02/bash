# bash
My collection of BASH scripts I find useful

Most of these scripts I made in the moment, but they work and they work wonderfully except I don't always remember to use them but when I do they help a lot.

Over time I will add more as I create more and remember where I placed them. Most of the time I do just do it in the terminal.

### TODO: START CREATING A WIKI FOR YOUR OWN SANITY SO YOU CAN REFERENCE IT WHEN YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED A COMPUTER OR ANY OF THESE SCRIPTS FOR MONTHS.

Don't think I do anything good enough for donations, but if you would like to support me and my future work I do have a buymeacofee:
