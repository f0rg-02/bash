# Scan Scripts

Basic scripts to find alive hosts and perform either a rustscan on a handful of ports or run netexec which is a nice replacement for crackmapexec after the stupid decision that the idiot devs made to make it partially open source.

I didn't really take as much time as I usually do with these scripts since I wanted something stupidly quick and dirty.

---

### Installation:

Utils used:

- uuidgen
- Netexec
- Rustscan

---

To install uuidgen you have to install `uuid-runtime` and with apt it would be: `sudo apt install uuid-runtime`

------

To install Netexec the wiki is here: https://www.netexec.wiki/getting-started/installation

I used pipx. Command for that is: `pipx install git+https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec`

You might need to install various other library development files.

To do that on Kali: `sudo apt install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev`

------

For Rustscan I cloned it directly from the git and built it myself using cargo build. The devs say to use the docker container because of some weird file descriptor bug or whatever, but running docker containers on a board with 2 GB is just not ideal and to me just seems laziness on the dev parts.

------

The commands to install rustscan are:

```
git clone https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan.git
cd RustScan/
cargo build --release
```
------

To install Rust, I used rustup here: https://rustup.rs/

Command I used is copied directly from the site above: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

---

### Usage:

Pretty straight forward for the scripts, but I wrote `init_scan.sh` to run just `find_alive.sh` and `run_nxc.sh`. The `alive_scan.sh` is to run both the nmap ping sweep to find alive hosts and also rustscan. This can be slower and not ideal depending on how much time you have. `run_nxc.sh` doesn't use all the protocols the tool can use and only uses four which was due to mostly speed and after some testing it was decided to shave it down to these specific ones.

------

Usage:

./find_alive.sh <interface> <output_file_to_save_results>

./run_nxc.sh <file_with_ips> <directory_to_save_results>

./alive_scan.sh <interface> <ports>

------

All results are saved in the log directory at: `/var/log/scans/network_scans/` with each invidual scan being saved in its own folder generated by uuid.
